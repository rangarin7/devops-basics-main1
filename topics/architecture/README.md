## 3. Trunk Based Development

A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called ‘trunk’ \*, resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.
